*  1-Dimensional train simulator, implementing physics equations for motion calculations
*  Given performance parameters of a train, provides functions to calculate:
*    Acceleration time, velocity, distance
*    Braking time, velocity, distance
*    Stop-to-stop time, average speed
*  Also provides and uses helper functions for US-to-metric unit conversions
*  See tester.py for sample usage
